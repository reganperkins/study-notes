reactive programming: when the module being changed is responsible for that change
  - listens to events and defines what happens to itself when those events happen
  example: cart is updated and broadcasts an update event, invoice reacts to the boadcast and updates cost
  - events, observations and self updates

passive programming: remote getters and setters


Reactive
  - how does it work? look inside
  - what does it effect? search for usages

Passive
  - how does it work? search for usages
  - what does it effect? look inside


Analytics is a great example of where reactive programming shines

observable: a stream of values (data, variables) over time
observer: 24m
