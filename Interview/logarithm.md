"What power must we raise this base to, in order to get this answer?"
log base 10 of 100 -> log_{10}{100} = 2

Used to solve for x
    10 ^x =100

Example:
Solve for 10^x = 100
We take the log_10 of both sides (we can do this—the two sides of the equation are still equal):

log_{10}{10^x} = log_{10}{100}

Now the left-hand side is asking, "what power must we raise 10 to in order to get 10^x?" The answer, of course, is x. So we can simplify that whole left side to just "x":

x = log_{10}{100}

We've pulled the x down from the exponent!

Now we just have to evaluate the right side. What power do we have to raise 10 to in order to get 100? The answer is still 2.

x = 2

That's how we use logarithms to pull a variable down from an exponent.
